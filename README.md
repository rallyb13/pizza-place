#Javascript Pizza Place
```
Here's the website to your new favorite pizza place.
You can order your topping (cheese vs. pepperoni),
specify the diameter (up to 48 inches, the size of our oven,
but feel free to enter numbers on either side of the 0 to 48 inch range).

The website will return to you the number of slices
(based on trying to cut perfect 5-inch crust arcs)
and the cost of your pizza
(based on the size category your specified diameter falls into).

Since I'm based in Portland, OR and this pizza place might expand,
I included a button for those ordering from a Vancouver location
to add sales tax (6.5%)
so that there are no surprises about the cost upon pickup/delivery.

#Bug Report
